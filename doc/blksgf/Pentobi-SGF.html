<h1>Pentobi SGF Files</h1>
<div style="font-size:small">Author: Markus Enzenberger<br>
Last modified: 2016-11-27</div>
<p>This document describes the file format for <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus">Blokus</a> game records as used by the
program <a href="http://pentobi.sourceforge.net">Pentobi</a>. The most recent
version of this document can be found in the source code distribution of
Pentobi in the folder pentobi/doc/blksgf.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The file format is a derivative of the <a href=
"http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/">Smart Game Format</a> (SGF). The current SGF
version 4 does not define standard properties for Blokus. Therefore, a number
of game-specific properties and value types had to be defined. The definitions
follow the recommendations of SGF 4 and the proposals for multi-player games
from the <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/ff5/ff5.htm">discussions</a>
about the future SGF version 5.</p>
<h2>File Extension and MIME Type</h2>
<p>The file extension <tt>.blksgf</tt> and the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">MIME type</a>
<tt>application/x-blokus-sgf</tt> are used for Blokus SGF files.</p>
<p style="font-size:small"><b>Note</b><br>
Since this is a non-standard MIME type, links to Blokus SGF files on web
servers will not automatically open the file with Pentobi even if Pentobi is
installed locally and registered as a handler for Blokus SGF files. To make
this work, you can put a file named <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess">.htaccess</a> on the web server in the
same directory that contains the .blksgf files or in one of its parent
directories. This file needs to contain the line:</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:small">AddType application/x-blokus-sgf
blksgf</blockquote>
<h2>Character Set</h2>
<p>Although not specific to Blokus, it is recommended to use <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> as the character set. Pentobi
always writes files in UTF-8 and indicates that with the <tt>CA</tt> property.
Pentobi can read SGF files encoded in UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 (Latin1). Other
character sets are currently not supported. As specified by the SGF standard,
ISO-8859-1 is assumed for files without <tt>CA</tt> property.</p>
<h2>Game Property</h2>
<p>Since there is no number for Blokus defined in SGF 4, a string instead of a
number is used as the value for the <tt>GM</tt> property. Currently, the
following strings are used: Blokus, Blokus Two-Player, Blokus Three-Player,
Blokus Duo, Blokus Trigon, Blokus Trigon Two-Player, Blokus Trigon
Three-Player, Blokus Junior, Nexos, Nexos Two-Player, Callisto, Callisto
Two-Player, Callisto Three-Player.</p>
The strings are case-sensitive, words are separated by exactly one space and no
additional whitespace at the beginning or end of the string is allowed.
<h2>Color and Player Properties</h2>
<p>In game variants with two players and two colors, <tt>B</tt> denotes the
first player or color, <tt>W</tt> the second player or color. In game variants
with three or four players and one color per player, <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>,
<tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt> denote the first, second, third, and fourth player or
color. In game variants with two players and four colors, <tt>B</tt> denotes
the first player, <tt>W</tt> the second player, and <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>,
<tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt> denote the first, second, third, and fourth color. This
applies to move properties and properties related to a player or a color.</p>
<p>Example 1: in the game variant Blokus Two-Player <tt>PW</tt> is the name of
the first player, and <tt>1</tt> is a move of the first color.</p>
<p>Example 2: in the game variant Blokus Two-Player, one could either use the
<tt>BL</tt>, <tt>WL</tt> properties to indicate the time left for a player, if
the game is played with a time limit for each player, or one could use the
<tt>1L</tt>, <tt>2L</tt>, <tt>3L</tt>, <tt>4L</tt> properties to indicate the
time left for a color, if the game is played with a time limit for each color.
(This is only an example how the properties should be interpreted. Pentobi
currently has no support for game clocks.)</p>
<p style="font-size:small"><b>Note</b><br>
Pentobi versions before 0.2 used the properties <tt>BLUE</tt>, <tt>YELLOW</tt>,
<tt>RED</tt>, <tt>GREEN</tt> in the four-color game variants, which did not
reflect the current state of discussion for SGF 5. Pentobi 12.0 erroneously
used multi-player properties for two-player Callisto. Current versions of
Pentobi can still read games written by older versions and will convert old
properties.</p>
<h2>Coordinate System</h2>
<p>Fields on the board (called points in SGF) are identified by a
case-insensitive string with a letter for the column followed by a number for
the row. The letters start with 'a', the numbers start with '1'. The lower left
corner of the board is 'a1'. The strings are not allowed to contain
whitespaces. Note that, unlike the common convention in the game of Go, the
letter 'i' is used.</p>
<p>If there are more than 26 columns, the columns continue with 'aa', 'ab',
..., 'ba', 'bb', ... More than 26 columns are presently required for Trigon and
could also be required for future game variants on rectangular boards larger
than 26×26.</p>
<p>For Trigon, hexagonal boards are mapped to rectangular coordinates as in the
following example of a hexagon with edge size 3:</p>
<pre>
       6     / \ / \ / \ / \
       5   / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
       4 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
       3 \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
       2   \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
       1     \ / \ / \ / \ /
          a b c d e f g h i j k
</pre>
<p>In Nexos, the 13×13 line grid is mapped to a 25×25 coordinate system, in
which rows with horizontal line segments and intersections alternate with rows
with vertical line segments and holes:</p>
<pre>
       6 |   |   |
       5 + - + - + -
       4 |   |   |
       3 + - + - + -
       2 |   |   |
       1 + - + - + -
         a b c d e f
</pre>
<h2>Move Properties</h2>
<p>The value of a move property is a string with the coordinates of the played
piece on the board separated by commas. No whitespace characters are allowed
before, after, or in-between the coordinates.</p>
<p>Pentobi currently does not require a certain order of the coordinates of a
move. However, move properties should be written with an ordered list of
coordinates (using the order a1, b1, …, a2, b2, …) such that each move has a
unique string representation.</p>
<p>Example: <tt>B[f9,e10,f10,g10,f11]</tt></p>
<p>In Nexos, moves contain only the coordinates of line segments occupied by
the piece, no coordinates of junctions.</p>
<p style="font-size:small"><b>Note</b><br>
Old versions of Pentobi (before version 0.3) used to represent moves by a list
of points, which did not follow the convention used by other games in SGF to
use single-value properties for moves. Current versions of Pentobi can still
read games containing the old move property values but they are deprecated and
should no longer be used.</p>
<h2>Setup Properties</h2>
<p>The setup properties <tt>AB</tt>, <tt>AW</tt>, <tt>A1</tt>, <tt>A2</tt>,
<tt>A3</tt>, <tt>A4</tt> can be used to place several pieces simultaneously on
the board. The setup property <tt>AE</tt> can be used to remove pieces from the
board. All these properties can have multiple values, each value represents a
piece by its coordinates as in the move properties. The <tt>PL</tt> can be used
to set the color to play in a setup position.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
<tt>AB[e8,e9,f9,d10,e10][g6,f7,g7,h7,g8]<br>
AW[i4,h5,i5,j5,i6][j7,j8,j9,k9,j10]<br>
PL[B]</tt></p>
<p style="font-size:small"><b>Note</b><br>
Older versions of Pentobi (before version 2.0) did not support setup
properties, you need a newer version of Pentobi to read such files. Currently,
Pentobi is able to read files with setup properties in any node, but can create
only files with setup in the root node.</p>
