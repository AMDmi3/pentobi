<h1>Pentobi GTP Interface</h1>
<div style="font-size:small">Author: Markus Enzenberger</div>
<p>This document describes the text-based interface to the engine of the Blokus
program <a href="https://pentobi.sourceforge.io">Pentobi</a>. The interface is
an adaption of the <a href="https://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">Go Text
Protocol</a> (GTP) and allows controller programs to use the engine in an
automated way without the GUI. The most recent version of this document can be
found in the source code distribution of Pentobi in the folder
pentobi/doc/gtp.</p>
<h2>Go Text Protocol</h2>
<p>The Go Text Protocol is a simple text-based protocol. The engine reads
single-line commands from its standard input stream and writes multi-line
responses to its standard output stream. The first character of a response is a
status character: <tt>=</tt> for success, <tt>?</tt> for failure, followed by
the actual response. The response ends with two consecutive newline characters.
See the <a href=
"https://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html">GTP
specification</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Controllers</h2>
<p>To use the engine from a controller program, the controller typically
creates a child process by running <tt>pentobi-gtp</tt> and then sends commands
and receives responses through the input/output streams of the child process.
How this is done, depends on the platform (programming language and/or
operating system). In Java, for example, a child process can be created with
<tt>java.lang.Runtime.exec()</tt>.</p>
<p>Note that the input/output streams of child processes are often fully
buffered. You should explicitly flush the output stream after sending a
command. Another caveat is that <tt>pentobi-gtp</tt> writes debugging
information to its standard error stream. On some platforms the standard error
stream of the child process is automatically connected to the standard error
stream of its parent process. If not (this happens for example in Java), the
controller needs to read everything from the standard error stream of the child
process. This can be done for example by running a separate thread in the
parent process that has a simple read loop, which writes everything that it
reads to its own standard error stream or discards it. Otherwise the child
process will block as soon as the buffer for its standard error stream is full.
Alternatively, you can disable debugging output of <tt>pentobi-gtp</tt> with
the command line option <tt>--quiet</tt>, but it is generally better to assume
that a GTP engine writes text to standard error.</p>
<p>An example for a controller written in C++ for Linux is included in Pentobi
since version 9.0 in <tt>src/twogtp</tt>. The controller starts two GTP engines
and plays a number of Blokus games between them. Older versions of Pentobi
included a Python script with a similar functionality in
<tt>tools/twogtp/twogtp.py</tt>.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>Since the GTP engine is a developer tool, building it is not enabled by
default. To enable it, run <tt>cmake</tt> with the option
<tt>-DPENTOBI_BUILD_GTP=ON</tt>. After building, there will be an executable in
the build directory named <tt>src/pentobi_gtp/pentobi-gtp</tt>. The GTP engine
requires only standard C++ and has no dependency on other libraries like Qt,
which is needed for the GUI version of Pentobi. If you only want to build the
GTP engine, you can disable building the GUI with
<tt>-DPENTOBI_BUILD_GUI=OFF</tt>.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>The following command-line options are supported by
<tt>pentobi-gtp</tt>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>--book <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>Specify a file name for the opening book. Opening books are blksgf files
containing trees, in which moves that Pentobi should select are marked as good
moves with the corresponding SGF property (see the files in
<tt>src/books</tt>). If no opening book is specified and opening books are not
disabled, <tt>pentobi-gtp</tt> will automatically search for an opening book
for the current game variant in the directory of the executable using the same
file name conventions as in <tt>src/books</tt>. If no such file is found it
will print an error message to standard error and disable the use of opening
books.</dd>
<dt>--config,-c <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>Load a file with GTP commands and execute them before starting the main
loop, which reads commands from standard input. This can be used for
configuration files that contain GTP commands for setting parameters of the
engine (see below).</dd>
<dt>--color</dt>
<dd>Use ANSI escape sequences to colorize the text output of boards (for
example in the response to the <tt>showboard</tt> command or with the
--showboard command line option).</dd>
<dt>--cputime</dt>
<dd>Use CPU time instead of wall time for time measurement. Currently, there is
no way to make Pentobi play with time limits, the levels are defined by the
number of simulations in the MCTS search, so this affects only the debugging
output, which prints the time used after each search.</dd>
<dt>--game,-g <i>variant</i></dt>
<dd>Specify the game variant used at start-up. Valid arguments are classic,
classic_2, duo, trigon, trigon_2, trigon_3, junior, nexos, nexos_2, gembloq,
gembloq_2, gembloq_3, gembloq_2_4, callisto, callisto_2, callisto_3,
callisto_2_4 or the abbreviations c, c2, d, t, t2, t3, j, n, n2, g, g2, g3,
g24, ca, ca2, ca3, ca24. By default, the initial game variant is classic. The
game variant can also be changed at run-time with a GTP command. If only a
single game variant is used, it is slightly faster and saves memory if the
engine is started in the right variant compared to having it start with classic
and then changing it.</dd>
<dt>--help,-h</dt>
<dd>Print a list of the command-line options and exit.</dd>
<dt>--level,-l <i>n</i></dt>
<dd>Set the level of playing strength to n. Valid values are 1 to 9.</dd>
<dt>--seed,-r <i>n</i></dt>
<dd>Use <i>n</i> as the seed for the random generator. Specifying a random seed
will make the move generation deterministic as long as the search is
single-threaded.</dd>
<dt>--showboard</dt>
<dd>Automatically write a text representation of the current position to
standard error after each command that alters the position.</dd>
<dt>--nobook</dt>
<dd>Disable the use of opening books.</dd>
<dt>--noresign</dt>
<dd>Disable resignation. If resignation is disabled, the <tt>genmove</tt>
command will never respond with <tt>resign</tt>. Resignation can speed up the
playing of test games if only the win/loss information is wanted.</dd>
<dt>--quiet,-q</dt>
<dd>Do not print any debugging messages, errors or warnings to standard
error.</dd>
<dt>--threads <i>n</i></dt>
<dd>Use <i>n</i> threads during the search. Note that the default is 1, unlike
in the GUI version of Pentobi, which sets the default according to the number
of hardware threads (CPUs, cores or virtual cores) available on the current
system. The reason is that, for example, using 2 threads makes the search twice
as fast but may lose a bit of playing strength compared to the single-threaded
search. Therefore, if the GTP engine is used to play many test games with
twogtp (which supports playing games in parallel), it is better to play the
games with single-threaded search in parallel than with multi-threaded search
sequentially. Using a large number of threads (e.g. more than 8) is untested
and might reduce the playing strength compared to the single-threaded
search.</dd>
<dt>--version,-v</dt>
<dd>Print the version of Pentobi and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<h3>Standard Commands</h3>
<p>The following GTP commands have the same or an equivalent meaning as
specified by the GTP standard. Colors or players in arguments or responses are
represented as in the property IDs of blksgf files (<tt>B</tt>, <tt>W</tt> if
two colors; <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, <tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt> if more than two).
Moves in arguments or responses are represented as in the move property values
of blksgf files. See the specification for <a href=
"https://pentobi.sourceforge.io/Pentobi-SGF.html">Pentobi SGF files</a> for
details.</p>
<dl>
<dt>all_legal <i>color</i></dt>
<dd>List all legal moves for a color.</dd>
<dt>clear_board</dt>
<dd>Clear the board and start a new game in the current game variant.</dd>
<dt>final_score</dt>
<dd>Get the score of a final board position. In two-player game variants, the
format of the response is as in the result property in the SGF standard for the
game of Go (e.g. <tt>B+2</tt> if the first player wins with two points, or
<tt>0</tt> for a draw). In game variants with more than two players, the
response is a list of the points for each player (e.g.
<tt>64&nbsp;69&nbsp;70&nbsp;40</tt>). If the current position is not a final
position, the response is undefined.</dd>
<dt>genmove <i>color</i></dt>
<dd>Generate and play a move for a given color in the current position. If the
color has no more moves, the response is <tt>pass</tt>. If resignation is not
disabled, the response is <tt>resign</tt> if the players is very likely to
lose. Otherwise the response is the move.</dd>
<dt>known_command <i>command</i></dt>
<dd>The response is <tt>true</tt> if <i>command</i> is a GTP command supported
by the engine, <tt>false</tt> otherwise.</dd>
<dt>list_commands</dt>
<dd>List all supported GTP commands, one command per line.</dd>
<dt>loadsgf <i>file</i> [<i>move_number</i>]</dt>
<dd>Load a board position from a blksgf file with name <i>file</i>. If
<i>move_number</i> is specified, the board position will be set to the position
in the main variation of the file <u>before</u> the move with the given number
was played, otherwise to the last position in the main variation.</dd>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Return the name of the GTP engine (<tt>Pentobi</tt>).</dd>
<dt>play <i>color</i> <i>move</i></dt>
<dd>Play a move for a given color in the current board position.</dd>
<dt>quit</dt>
<dd>Exit the command loop and quit the engine.</dd>
<dt>reg_genmove <i>color</i></dt>
<dd>Like the <tt>genmove</tt> command, but only generates a move and does not
play it on the board.</dd>
<dt>showboard</dt>
<dd>Return a text representation of the current board position.</dd>
<dt>undo</dt>
<dd>Undo the last move played.</dd>
<dt>version</dt>
<dd>Return the version of Pentobi.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Generally Useful Extension Commands</h3>
<dl>
<dt>cputime</dt>
<dd>Return the CPU time used by the engine since the start of the program.</dd>
<dt>g</dt>
<dd>Shortcut for the <tt>genmove</tt> command with the color argument set to
the current color to play.</dd>
<dt>get_place <i>color</i></dt>
<dd>Get the place of a given color in the list of scores in a final position
(e.g. in game variant Classic, 1 is the place with the highest score, 4 the one
with the lowest, if all players have a different score). If some colors have
the same score, they share the same place and the string <tt>shared</tt> is
appended to the place number.</dd>
<dt>get_value</dt>
<dd>Get an estimated value of the board position from the view point of the
color of the last generated move. The return value is a win/loss estimation
between 0 (loss) and 1 (win) as produced by the last search performed by the
engine. This command should only be used immediately after a
<tt>reg_genmove</tt> or <tt>genmove</tt> command, otherwise the result is
undefined. The value is not very meaningful at the lowest playing levels. Note
that no searches are performed if the opening book is used for a move
generation and there is currently no way to check if this was so. Therefore,
the opening book should be disabled if the <tt>get_value</tt> command is
used.</dd>
<dt>p <i>move</i></dt>
<dd>Shortcut for the <tt>play</tt> command with the color argument set to the
current color to play.</dd>
<dt>param [<i>key</i> <i>value</i>]</dt>
<dd>Set or query parameters specific to the Pentobi engine that can be changed
at run-time. If no arguments are given, the response is a list of the current
value with one key/value pair per line, otherwise the parameter with the given
key will be set to the given value. Generally useful parameters are:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>avoid_symmetric_draw 0|1</dt>
<dd>In some game variants (Duo, Trigon_2), the second player can enforce a tie
by answering each move by its symmetric counterpart if the first players misses
the opportunity to break the symmetry in the center. Technically, exploiting
this mistake by the first player is a good strategy for the second player
because a draw is a good result considering the first-play advantage. However,
playing symmetrically could be considered bad style, so this behavior is
avoided (value <tt>1</tt>) by default.</dd>
<dt>fixed_simulations <i>n</i></dt>
<dd>Use exactly <i>n</i> MCTS simulations during a search. By default, the
search engine uses levels, which determine how many MCTS simulations are run
during a search, but as a function that increases with the move number (because
the simulations become much faster at the end of the game). For some
experiments, it can be desirable to use a fixed number of simulations for each
move. If this number is specified, the playing level is ignored.</dd>
<dt>use_book 0|1</dt>
<dd>Enable or disable the opening book.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
The other parameters are only interesting for developers.</dd>
<dt>param_base [<i>key</i> <i>value</i>]</dt>
<dd>Set or query basic parameters that are not specific to the Pentobi engine.
If no arguments are given, the response is a list of the current value with one
key/value pair per line, otherwise the parameter with the given key will be set
to the given value.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>accept_illegal 0|1</dt>
<dd>Accept move arguments to the <tt>play</tt> command that violate the rules
of the game. If disabled, the <tt>play</tt> command will respond with an error,
otherwise it will perform the moves.</dd>
<dt>resign 0|1</dt>
<dd>Allow the engine to respond with <tt>resign</tt> to the <tt>genmove</tt>
command.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>set_game <i>variant</i></dt>
<dd>Set the current game variant and clear the board. The argument is the name
of the game variant as in the game property value of blksgf files (e.g.
<tt>Blokus&nbsp;Duo</tt>, see the specification for <a href=
"https://pentobi.sourceforge.io/Pentobi-SGF.html">Pentobi SGF files</a> for
details).</dd>
<dt>set_random_seed <i>n</i></dt>
<dd>Set the seed of the random generator to <i>n</i>. See the documentation for
the command-line option --seed.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Extension Commands for Developers</h3>
The remaining commands are only interesting for developers. See Pentobi's
source code for details.
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following GTP session queries the engine name and version, plays and
generates a move in game variant Duo and shows the resulting board position.
