<h2>How to Use Pentobi</h2>
<h3>Board</h3>
<p>Pieces can be selected by clicking on one of the unplayed pieces or by using
<a href="shortcuts.html">shortcut keys</a>. Pieces can be played by dragging
them to a place that corresponds to a legal move with the mouse or arrow keys
and pressing the left mouse button or the Enter key.</p>
<p>Played pieces on the board can have numbers on them that indicate the move
number in which the piece was played. A letter after the move number indicates
that there exists a variation to this move (see below).</p>
<p>The score display shows the current points for each color or player. The
points are the sum of on-board points and bonus points. Points are underlined
if they are final because the color cannot play more pieces. A small star
indicates that the points include a bonus.</p>
<h3>Playing Against the Computer</h3>
<p>The board can be used for creating game records of games played by humans or
for playing games against the computer. In games against the computer, the
computer can play any (or several) of the colors.</p>
<p>When you start a new game, the human will play the color(s) of the first
player by default and the computer all other colors. To change this, use
<i>Computer Colors</i> from the <i>Computer</i> menu or toolbar and select the
colors the computer should play.</p>
<p>The exception is that the computer will play no color by default if it
played no color in the previous game. This prevents the computer from
automatically starting to play if the user mainly wants to use the board for
entering move sequences or similar editing tasks. After loading a saved game,
the computer also plays no color by default.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Play</i> from the <i>Computer</i> menu or the toolbar always
makes the computer play a move for the current color. If the computer did not
already play this color before, it will also make the computer play this color
(and only this color) from now on.</p>
<h3>Move Variations and the Game Tree</h3>
<p>When you play a game, Pentobi will store the sequence of moves and it is
always possible to go back to a previous position and play differently. If you
do this, the new sequence is stored as an alternative sequence (called
variation). Variations can also be used by annotators for commenting on
existing games. Variations can exist at any board position and can have
subvariations themselves. The game can therefore become a game tree, in which
each node represents a board position. You can navigate in the game tree with
the items in the <i>Go</i> menu and the navigation buttons.</p>
<p>The main variation is the sequence of moves that starts at the start
position and always selects the first child node in each position (e.g. by
pressing the <i>Forward</i> button). The main variation is supposed to
represent the real game played. If you want a side variation to become the main
variation, select <i>Make Main Variation</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu.</p>
