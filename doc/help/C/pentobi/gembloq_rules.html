<h2>GembloQ Rules</h2>
<p>GembloQ is a board game similar to Blokus. The squares of the board are
rotated by 45 degrees. The board has a diagonal size of 27 squares. In addition
to the full squares, the edges also contain half squares such that the edges
are straight lines.</p>

<p>Each player has a set of 21 pieces, which include a subset of the pieces
used in Blokus, but also some pieces that contain a half square.</p>

<p>As in Blokus, the starting squares are in the corners, the first move must
fully cover the starting square of the color and subsequent moves must touch a
piece of the player color at a vertex, but not edge-to-edge. Moves are also
legal, if a vertex of a half square touches an edge of a piece of the same
color.</p>

<p>Scoring is done like in Blokus, half squares count 0.5 points. Bonus points
are not used. Tie breaking by assigning additional values to the pieces, as
described in the official GembloQ rules, is currently not supported by
Pentobi.</p>
<h3>Rules for Two and Three Players</h3>
<p>The game variants for two and three players use smaller boards and different
starting point locations. In addition to the standard two-player variant,
Pentobi also supports a game variant for two players like in Blokus, in which
each player plays two colors.</p>
