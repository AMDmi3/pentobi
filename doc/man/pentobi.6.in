.SH NAME
pentobi \- computer opponent for the board game Blokus

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pentobi
.RI [ options ] " [file]"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pentobi
is the command to invoke the program Pentobi, which is a graphical user
interface and computer opponent to play the board game Blokus.

The command can take the name of a game file to open at startup as an optional
argument.
The game file is expected to be in Pentobi's SGF format as documented in
doc/blksgf/Pentobi-SGF.html in the Pentobi source package.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-memory
The amount of memory in bytes to be used by the search.
If this option is not used, it depends on the amount of physical memory
available on the system how much memory Pentobi will allocate (currently up
to 1.3 GB).
If the memory for the search is too low, the playing strength at higher
playing levels will be impaired.
This can be checked by running Pentobi with option \-\-verbose in a game variant
with a high number of Monte-Carlo simulations per second (e.g. Duo).
If a message that the search tree was pruned occurs more than a few times
during a move generation, the playing strength is likely to be affected.
.TP
.B \-\-threads
The number of threads to use in the search. By default, up to 4 threads are
used in the search depending on the number of hardware threads supported
by the current system.
Using more threads will speed up the move generation but using a very high
number of threads (e.g. more than 8) can degrade the playing strength
in higher playing levels.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Print internal information about the move generation and other debugging
information to standard error.
