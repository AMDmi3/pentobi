.SH NAME
pentobi \- computer opponent for the board game Blokus

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pentobi
.RI [ options ] " [file]"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pentobi
is the command to invoke the program Pentobi, which is a graphical user
interface and computer opponent to play the board game Blokus.

The command can take the name of a game file to open at startup as an optional
argument.
The game file is expected to be in Pentobi's SGF format as documented in
doc/blksgf/Pentobi-SGF.html in the Pentobi source package.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-maxlevel
Set the maximum playing level. Reducing this value reduces the amount
of memory used by the search, which can be useful to run Pentobi on systems
that have low memory or are too slow to use the highest levels.
By default, Pentobi currently allocates up to 2 GB (but not more than a third
of the physical memory available on the system).
Reducing the maximum level to 8 currently reduces this amount by a factor
of 6 and lower maximum levels even more.
.TP
.B \-\-threads
The number of threads to use in the search. By default, up to 4 threads are
used in the search depending on the number of hardware threads supported
by the current system.
Using more threads will speed up the move generation but using a very high
number of threads (e.g. more than 8) can degrade the playing strength
in higher playing levels.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Print internal information about the move generation and other debugging
information to standard error.
