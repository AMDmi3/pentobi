.SH NAME
pentobi \- computer program that plays the board game Blokus

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pentobi
.RI [ options ] " [file]"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pentobi
is the command to invoke the program Pentobi, which is a graphical user
interface and computer opponent to play the board game Blokus.

The command can take the name of a game file to open at startup as an optional
argument.
The game file is expected to be in Blokus SGF format as documented in
doc/blksgf/Blokus-SGF.html in the Pentobi source package.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-memory
The amount of memory in bytes to be used by the search.
The default value is 384000000 (384 kB).
This option can be used to reduce the memory requirements on low-end systems
but it can have a negative effect on the playing strength.
If the search runs out of memory, it will prune nodes with a low visit count
from the search tree and these nodes may have to be searched again after the
search continues.
You can check how often the pruning happens by running Pentobi in game variant
Duo (which has the highest number of simulations per second) at the highest
level with option --verbose and looking at the messages during move generation.
Pruning the tree a few times during a search will not affect the playing
strength much but a large number of prunings will.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Print internal information about the move generation and other debugging
information to standard error.
