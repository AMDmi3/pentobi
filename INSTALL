This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Boost libraries (>=1.40) and the Qt libraries (>=4.6).
The C++ compiler needs to support certain C++11 features (only features that
are already implemented by MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.4). For creating cross-platform
makefiles, CMake (>=2.8) is required.

Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if used with
certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x (e.g. the combinations
GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04 and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work
but the combination GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).

Ubuntu 12.04 provides suitable versions of the required tools and libraries in
its package repository. The packages can be installed with the shell command:

  sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake libqt4-dev libboost-all-dev


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled with CMake using the shell commands:

  cmake .
  make

If a compatible version of the Boost libraries is not installed on the system,
it is possible to specify a custom location of Boost using the cmake options
-DBOOST_ROOT, -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR and -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=1. In this case,
it is advisable to also use -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=1 if Pentobi should be
installed system-wide because CMake removes a compile-time custom path for
finding dynamic libraries at installation time. If you use a newer version of
Boost that was not known to your version of CMake, you may have to add the
version to Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS in CMakeLists.txt before running cmake.
Type "cmake --help-module FindBoost" for more information.

On Unix systems that support only Gnome 3, it is unnecessary to install
the Gnome 2 registration files for the Pentobi thumbnailer. They can be
disabled by using the cmake option -DPENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER=OFF.


== Installing ==

On Unix, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu, register it as handler for Blokus
files (*.blksgf), and register its Gnome thumbnailer for file previews.
The databases can be updated with the shell command:

  sudo make post-install

This make target assumes that the commands update-desktop-database and
update-mime-database exist (and gconftool-2 unless the Gnome 2 thumbnailer
registration was disabled with PENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER=OFF).
