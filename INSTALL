This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Qt libraries (>=5.11). The C++ compiler needs C++14
support (GCC >=4.9). The build system uses CMake (>=3.1.0).

In Debian-based distributions that support Qt >=5.11, the necessary tools
and libraries can be installed with the command:

  sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libqt5svg5-dev libqt5webview5-dev make \
    qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings \
    qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-controls2 \
    qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2 \
    qml-module-qtwebview qt5-default qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qttools5-dev


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled from the source directory with the command:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
  make


=== Building the KDE thumbnailer plugin ===

A thumbnailer plugin for KDE can be built by using the cmake option
-DPENTOBI_BUILD_KDE_THUMBNAILER=1. In this case, the KDE development files
need to be installed (packages libkf5kio-dev and extra-cmake-modules on
Debian-based distributions). Note that the plugin might not be found if
the default installation prefix /usr/local is used. You need to add
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/plugins to /etc/environment. After that, you
can enable previews for Blokus game file in the Dolphin file manager in
"Configure Dolphin/General/Previews".


== Installing ==

On Linux, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu and register it as handler for
Blokus files (*.blksgf). On Debian-based distributions with install prefix
/usr/local, this can be done by running:

  sudo update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime
  sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications


== Building the Android version ==

Because building, deploying and debugging for Android is not yet functional
for CMake projects in QtCreator, there exists a project file in
src/pentobi/Pentobi.pro for building the Android app.
