This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Boost libraries (>=1.40) and the Qt libraries (>=4.6).
The C++ compiler needs to support certain features from the coming C++ standard
(only features that are already implemented by MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.4 with option
-std=c++0x). For creating cross-platform makefiles, CMake (>=2.8) is required.

Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if used with
certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x (e.g. the combinations
GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04 and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work
but the combination GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled with CMake using the shell commands:

  cmake .
  make

If a compatible version of the Boost libraries is not installed on the system,
it is possible to specify a custom location of Boost using the cmake options
-DBOOST_ROOT, -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR and -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=1. In this case,
it is advisable to also use -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=1 if Pentobi should be
installed system-wide because CMake removes a compile-time custom path for
finding dynamic libraries at installation time. If you use a newer version of
Boost that was not known to your version of CMake, you may have to add the
version to Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS in CMakeLists.txt before running cmake.
Type "cmake --help-module FindBoost" for more information.


== Installing ==

On Unix, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu, register it as handler for Blokus
(*.blksgf) files, and register its Gnome thumbnailer for file previews.
The databases can be updated with the shell command:

  sudo make post-install
