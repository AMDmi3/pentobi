This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Qt libraries (>=5.6). The C++ compiler needs C++14
support (GCC >=4.9). The build system uses CMake (>=3.1.0).

Ubuntu 18.04 provides suitable versions of the required tools and libraries in
its package repository. They can be installed with the shell command:

  sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev \
      qtdeclarative5-dev libqt5webview5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled from the source directory with the shell commands:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
  make


== Installing ==

On Linux, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu and register it as handler for Blokus
files (*.blksgf). On Ubuntu 18.04 with install prefix /usr/local, this can be
done by running:

  sudo update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime
  sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications


== Building the Android version ==

For building the Android app, there is a QtCreator project file in
src/pentobi_qml/Pentobi.pro. It requires Qt >=5.8.

For testing purposes, the GUI that is used for Android can also be built as a
desktop application by running CMake with -DPENTOBI_BUILD_QML=1 (needs the
packages qtdeclarative5-dev, libqt5webview5-dev, qml-module-qt-labs-settings,
qml-module-qtquick-dialogs, qml-module-qtquick-layouts,
qml-module-qtquick-window2, qml-module-qtquick2, qml-module-qtquick-controls,
qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel, qml-module-qtquick-controls2 on
Ubuntu 18.04).
