This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Qt libraries (>=5.11). The C++ compiler needs C++14
support (GCC >=4.9). The build system uses CMake (>=3.1.0).

In Debian-based distributions that support Qt >=5.11, the necessary tools
and libraries can be installed with the command:

  sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libqt5svg5-dev libqt5webview5-dev \
    make qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings \
    qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-controls2 \
    qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2 qtbase5-dev \
    qtdeclarative5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled from the source directory with the command:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
  make


== Installing ==

On Linux, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu and register it as handler for
Blokus files (*.blksgf). On Debian-based distributions with install prefix
/usr/local, this can be done by running:

  sudo update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime
  sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications


== Building the Android version ==

Because building, deploying and debugging for Android is not yet functional
for CMake projects in QtCreator, there exists a project file in
src/pentobi/Pentobi.pro for building the Android app.
