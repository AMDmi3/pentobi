This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Qt libraries (>= 5.1). The C++ compiler needs to support
certain C++11 features (only features that are already implemented by GCC 4.8
and MSVC 2013). For creating cross-platform makefiles, CMake (>= 3.0.2) is
required.

Ubuntu 15.10 provides suitable versions of the required tools and libraries in
its package repository. They can be installed with the shell command:

  sudo apt-get install \
    g++ make cmake qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled from the source directory with the shell commands:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
  make


=== Building the KDE thumbnailer plugin ===

A thumbnailer plugin for KDE can be built by using the cmake option
-DPENTOBI_BUILD_KDE_THUMBNAILER=1. In this case, the KDE development files
need to be installed (packages kio-dev and extra-cmake-modules on
Ubuntu 15.10). Note that on Ubuntu 15.10, the plugin will only be found if
installed to the default plugin directory. Use the cmake option
-DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=1 to enforce this. After that, you can
enable previews for Blokus game file in the Dolphin file manager in
"Configure Dolphin/General/Previews".


== Installing ==

On Linux, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu and register it as handler for Blokus
files (*.blksgf). On Ubuntu 15.04 with install prefix /usr/local, this can be
done by running:

  sudo update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime
  sudo update-desktop-database /usr/local/share/applications


== Building the Android version ==

Since CMake does not support Android yet, there is a QtCreator project
file in src/pentobi_qml/Pentobi.pro for building the Android app.
Before compilation, the binary translation files need to be generated
by using File/Release in Qt Linguist for all TS files in
src/pentobi_qml/qml/translations.

For testing purposes, the GUI that is used for Android can also be built as a
desktop application by running CMake with -DPENTOBI_BUILD_QML=1. It requires
at least Qt 5.3.
