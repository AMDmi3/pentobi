This file explains how to compile and install Pentobi from the sources.


== Requirements ==

Pentobi requires the Qt libraries (>= 4.8). The C++ compiler needs to support
certain C++11 features (only features that are already implemented by GCC 4.7
and MSVC 2012). For creating cross-platform makefiles, CMake (>= 2.8.9) is
required.

Ubuntu 12.10 provides suitable versions of the required tools and libraries in
its package repository. The packages can be installed with the shell command:

  sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libqt4-dev make


== Building ==

Pentobi can be compiled with CMake using the shell commands:

  cmake .
  make

Because of a non-functional C++11 threads implementation on MinGW GCC 4.7
(and potentially other platforms), it is still possible to compile Pentobi
using Boost.Thread instead of C++11 threads by using the CMake option
-DUSE_BOOST_THREAD=ON. In this case, the Boost libraries (>= 1.49) need to
be installed.

A thumbnailer plugin for KDE can be built by using the CMake option
-DPENTOBI_BUILD_KDE_THUMBNAILER=ON. In this case, the KDE development files
need to be installed (package kdelibs5-dev on Ubuntu 12.10). Note that on
Ubuntu 12.10, the plugin will not be found if the default installation prefix
/usr/local is used. You need to add KDEDIRS=/usr/local to /etc/environment.
After that, you can enable previews for Blokus game file in the Dolphin file
manager in "Configure Dolphin/General/Previews".


== Installing ==

On Linux, Pentobi can be installed after compilation with the shell command:

  sudo make install

After installation, the system-wide databases should be updated to
make Pentobi appear in the desktop menu, register it as handler for Blokus
files (*.blksgf), and register its Gnome thumbnailer for file previews.
The databases can be updated with the shell command:

  sudo make post-install

This make target assumes that the commands update-desktop-database and
update-mime-database exist.
