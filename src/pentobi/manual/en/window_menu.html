    <h3>The Window Menu Explained</h3>

    <h4>Game</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>New</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Start a new game.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Rated Game</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Start a new <a href="become_stronger.html#rating">rated game</a>
	against the computer.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Game Variant</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Select a game variant and start a new game of this game variant.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Computer Colors</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Select which colors are played by the computer.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Game Info</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Display or edit additional information about the game like the
	name of the players or the date when the game was played.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Undo Move</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Undo the last move played and remove it from the game tree.
	Undoing a move is only possible if it is the last move in the
	current variation (i.e. a leaf node in the game tree; use
	<i>Edit/Truncate</i> to remove inner nodes of the game tree).
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Find Move</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Find a legal move for the current color and display it for a few
	seconds on the board. Selecting this item repeatedly will show all
	legal moves.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Open</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Load a saved game.
	The board position after loading will be the last position in the
	main variation unless the game starts with a setup position.
	If the game starts with a setup, the board position will be the first
	position instead.
	This avoids that solutions are immediately shown if the file contains
	a Blokus puzzle as a setup with the solution as the main variation.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Open Recent</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Load a recently used saved game.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Save</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current game.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Save As</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current game under a new file name.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Export/Image</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current position as an image file.
	Several image file formats are supported, the file format
	is derived from the file name ending (e.g. ".png" for the PNG format).
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Export/ASCII Art</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current position as a text diagram.
	The text diagram should be viewed using a monospace font.
      </dd>

      <dd>

      <dt><i>Forward</i></dt>
      <dd>

	variation will be used.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>10 Forward</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Go ten moves forward in the current variation.
	Like Forward, this also uses the first variation in positions with
	several follow-up variations.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>End</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the end of the current variation.

	several follow-up variations.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Next Variation</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the next variation to the last move played (i.e. the next sibling
	node of the current node in the game tree).
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Previous Variation</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the previous variation to the last move played (i.e. the previous
	sibling node of the current node in the game tree).

	in the game tree.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Edit</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Move Annotation</i></dt>
      <dd>

      </dd>
      <dt><i>Make Main Variation</i></dt>
      <dd>

      <dd>
	Changes the order of variations such that the current position
	will appear earlier when iterating over the variations with
	<i>Next/Previous Variation</i>.
      </dd>

      <dd>

      <dd>
	Delete all variations but the main variation.
	If the current position is not on the main variation, it will be

      </dd>
      <dt><i>Truncate</i></dt>
      <dd>

	from the game tree.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Truncate Children</i></dt>

	the game tree.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Keep Only Position</i></dt>

      <dd>
	Enter or leave setup mode.
	In setup mode, pieces can be placed anywhere on the board, even
	in violation of the game rules.
	Existing pieces can be removed from the board by clicking on them.
	The currently selected color also determines the color to play after
	the setup is finished.
	It can be changed with <i>Select Next Color</i> or by clicking on the
	orientation selector while no piece is selected.
	Setup mode can only be used if no moves have been played.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Select Next Color</i></dt>
      <dd>
	Choose the next color for selecting pieces.
	This can be used for example to enter game records in which moves
