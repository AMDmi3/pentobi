    <h3>The Window Menu Explained</h3>

    <h4>File</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Open</dt>
      <dd>
	Load a saved game.
      </dd>
      <dt>Open Recent</dt>
      <dd>
	Load a recently used saved game.
      </dd>
      <dt>Save</dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current game.

      </dd>
      <dt>Export/Image</dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current position as an image file.
	Several image file formats are supported, the file format
	is derived from the file name ending (e.g. ".png" for the PNG format).
      </dd>
      <dt>Export/ASCII Art</dt>
      <dd>
	Save the current position as a text diagram.
	The text diagram should be viewed using a monospace font.
      </dd>
      <dt>Quit</dt>
      <dd>
	Quit Pentobi.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Game</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>New Game</dt>
      <dd>
	Start a new game.
      </dd>
      <dt>Game Variant</dt>
      <dd>
	Select a game variant and start a new game of this game variant.
      </dd>
      <dt>Computer Color</dt>
      <dd>
	Select which colors are played by the computer.
      </dd>
      <dt>Game Info</dt>
      <dd>
	Display or edit additional information about the game like the
	name of the players or the date when the game was played.
      </dd>
      <dt>Undo Move</dt>
      <dd>
	Undo the last move played and remove it from the game tree.
	Undoing a move is only possible if it is the last move in the
	current variation (i.e. a leaf node in the game tree; use Edit/Truncate
	to remove inner nodes of the game tree).
      </dd>
      <dt>Find Move</dt>
      <dd>
	Find a legal move for the current color and display it for a few
	seconds on the board. Selecting this item repeatedly will show all
	legal moves.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Go</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Beginning</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the beginning of the game.
      </dd>
      <dt>Ten Moves Backward</dt>
      <dd>
	Go ten moves backward in the current variation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Backward</dt>
      <dd>
	Go one move backward in the current variation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Forward</dt>
      <dd>
	Go one move forward in the current variation.
	If the current position has several follow-up variations (i.e. the
	current node in the game tree has several child nodes), the first
	variation will be used.
      </dd>
      <dt>Ten Moves Forward</dt>
      <dd>
	Go ten moves forward in the current variation.
	Like Forward, this also uses the first variation in positions with
	several follow-up variations.
      </dd>
      <dt>End</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the end of the current variation.
	Like Forward, this also uses the first variation in positions with
	several follow-up variations.
      </dd>
      <dt>Next Variation</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the next variation to the last move played (i.e. the next sibling
	node of the current node in the game tree).
      </dd>
      <dt>Previous Variation</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the previous variation to the last move played (i.e. the previous
	sibling node of the current node in the game tree).
      </dd>
      <dt>Go to Move</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the move with a given move number in the current variation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Back to Main Variation</dt>
      <dd>
	Return to the last move in the main variation that had a variation.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Edit</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Find Next Comment</dt>
      <dd>
	Go to the next position that has a comment.
	If the comment text field was not visible, it will become visible.
	Selecting this item repeatedly will show all positions with comments
	in the game tree.
      </dd>
      <dt>Move Annotation</dt>
      <dd>
	Add a chess-style move annotation symbol (e.g. !!) to the current move.
	Annotation symbols are shown after the move numbers on the board and
	only visible if move numbers are shown.
      </dd>
      <dt>Make Main Variation</dt>
      <dd>
	Make the current variation the main variation of the game.
	This reorders the nodes in the game tree such that the current variation
	becomes the main variation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Truncate</dt>
      <dd>
	Remove the node with the current position, including any subtree,
	from the game tree.
      </dd>
      <dt>Select Next Color</dt>
      <dd>
	Choose the next color for selecting pieces.
	This can be used for example to enter game records in which moves
	of a color were skipped because the color ran out of time.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>View</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Toolbar</dt>
      <dd>
	Show or hide the toolbar.
      </dd>
      <dt>Comment</dt>
      <dd>
	Show or hide a text field to display or edit comments on the current
	position.
      </dd>
      <dt>Fullscreen</dt>
      <dd>
	Make the main window fullscreen or leave fullscreen mode.
	It is platform-dependent if the window menu is shown in fullscreen mode.
	To leave fullscreen mode without using the window menu, use the small
	button at the right of the status bar or press the F11 key.
      </dd>
      <dt>Move Numbers</dt>
      <dd>
	Change the way move numbers are displayed on the board.
	The options are to show only the number of the last move or of all
	moves or to show no numbers at all.
      </dd>
      <dt>Coordinate Labels</dt>
      <dd>
	Display coordinate labels for the fields on the board around the
	board.
	The convention for labeling coordinates is the same as in the
	Blokus SGF file format used by Pentobi.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Computer</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Play</dt>
      <dd>
	Make the computer play a move for the current color.
	This can be used to change the color the computer plays or to
	resume playing after navigating in the game tree.
	If the computer did not already play the current color, it will play
	this color (and only this color) from now on.
      </dd>
      <dt>Interrupt</dt>
      <dd>
	Interrupt the current move generation.
	The computer will play the best move it has found so far.
      </dd>
      <dt>Level</dt>
      <dd>
	Change the playing strength of the computer.
	Higher levels are stronger but can make the computer take a long
	time for playing moves on slow computers.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Help</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Contents</dt>
      <dd>
	Show a window to browse the Pentobi user manual.
      </dd>
