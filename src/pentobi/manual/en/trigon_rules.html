    <h3>Trigon Rules</h3>
    <p>
      Trigon is another game variant. The rules a similar to game variant
      Classic but it uses a differently shaped board and set of pieces.
      Each color uses 22 pieces that are shaped like the polyiamonds up to size
      six. (A polyiamond is a figure built by a number of equilateral triangles
      connected along the edges.)

      There are six starting points on the board, each located four rows
      from the middle of an edge. The starting points are not colored and
      the players may freely choose a starting point for the first piece
      of a color.

      Like in game variant Classic, Trigon can be played with two players by
      having one player play Blue and Red and the other player Yellow and
      Green.

    <h3>Trigon Rules for Three Players</h3>
    <p>
      Trigon can be played with three players using the same rules as
      for the four-player variant.

      of eight triangles.
      The six starting points are located three rows from the middle of an edge.
