<h3>How to Use Pentobi</h3>
<h3>Board</h3>
<p>Pentobi's main window shows the board on the left side. The
played pieces on the board can have numbers on them that indicate
the move number in which the piece was played. An letter after the
move number indicates that there exists a variation to this move
(see below).</p>
<p>Pieces can be played by moving them to a place that corresponds
to a legal move with the mouse or arrow keys and pressing the left
mouse button or the Enter key.</p>
<h3>Pieces and Score</h3>
<p>On the right side, the remaining pieces are shown. Above the
remaining pieces is an orientation selector that shows the
currently selected piece and allows the player to change its
orientation. If no piece is selected and the game has not yet
ended, a colored dot in the orientation selector shows the color to
play.</p>
<p>Pieces can be selected by clicking on one of the remaining
pieces shown, by using the left/right arrow buttons in the
orientation selector or by using <a href="shortcuts.html">shortcut
keys</a>.</p>
<p>Below the orientation selector is a score display, which
displays the current points for each color or player. The points
are the sum of on-board points and bonus points. Points are
underlined if they are final (because the color cannot play more
pieces). In game variant Classic for three players, in which players
take turns playing Green, the green dot in the score display contains
a smaller dot with the color of the player who plays the next move
for Green.</p>
<h3>Playing Against the Computer</h3>
<p>The board can be used for entering moves played by humans or for
playing games against the computer. In games against the computer,
the computer can play any (or several) of the colors.</p>
<p>When you start a new game, the human will play the color(s) of
the first player by default and the computer all other colors. To
change this, use <i>Computer Colors</i> from the <i>Computer</i>
menu or toolbar and select the colors the computer should play.</p>
<p>The exception is that the computer will play no color by
default, if it played no color in the previous game. This prevents
the computer from automatically starting to play if the user mainly
wants to use the board for entering move sequences or similar
editing tasks. So if you want to use the board without playing
against the computer, you need to disable the computer colors in
the <i>Computer Colors</i> dialog only once and it will stay that
way. After loading a saved game, the computer also plays no color
by default.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Play</i> from the <i>Computer</i> menu or the
toolbar always makes the computer play a move for the current
color. If the computer did not already play this color before, it
will also make the computer play this color (and only this color)
from now on.</p>
<h3>Move Variations and the Game Tree</h3>
<p>When you play a game, Pentobi will store the sequence of moves
and it is always possible to go back to a previous position and
play differently. If you do this, the new sequence is stored as an
alternative sequence (called a variation). Variations can also be
used by annotators for commenting on existing games. Variations can
exist at any board position and can have subvariations themselves.
The game can therefore become a game tree, in which each node
represents a board position. You can navigate in the game tree with
the items in the <i>Go</i> menu or in the toolbar.</p>
<p>The main variation is the sequence of moves that starts at the
start position and always selects the first child node in each
position (e.g. by selecting <i>Forward</i> in the <i>Go</i> menu or
toolbar). The main variation is supposed to represent the real game
played. If you want a side variation to become the main variation,
select <i>Make Main Variation</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu.</p>
