<h2>Classic Rules</h2>
<p>There are four players, Blue, Yellow, Red and Green, and a board
consisting of 20×20 squares.</p>
<p>Each player has a set of 21 pieces of his colour shaped like the
polyominoes up to size five. (A polyomino is a figure built by a
number of squares connected along the edges.)</p>

<div align="center" class="caption">The 21 pieces.</div>
<p>The players alternate in placing one of their pieces on the
board. Blue starts, followed by Yellow, then Red, then Green.</p>
<p>Each player has a starting square. Blue's starting square is in
the top left corner, Yellow's in the top right corner, Red's in the
bottom right corner, and Green's in the bottom left corner. The
first piece of a player must cover its starting square.</p>

<div align="center" class="caption">The 20×20 board with the

squares marked with coloured dots.</div>
<p>The following pieces must be placed on empty squares such that
the new piece touches at least one piece of its own colour corner
by corner but does not touch a piece of its own colour along the
edges. The new piece may touch edges of pieces of the opponent
colours.</p>

moves.</div>
<p>When the player of a colour cannot place any more pieces, the
player passes and the next colour continues.</p>
<p>When no player can place any more pieces, the player with the
highest score wins. The score of a colour is the number of squares
on the board occupied by the colour, plus a bonus of 15 points if
the colour could place all of its pieces, plus an additional bonus
of 5 points if the colour could place all pieces and the last piece
played was the one-square piece.</p>
<h3>Classic Rules for Two Players</h3>
<p>The game can be played with two players. The first player plays
both Blue and Red, the second player Yellow and Green. The points
of both colours that a player plays are added.</p>
<h3>Classic Rules for Three Players</h3>
<p>The game can also be played with three players. The players take turns
playing the fourth colour (Green). At the end of the game, the score of
Green is ignored.</p>
<h3>Colourless starting points</h3>
<p>Note that the original Blokus Classic rules use colourless
starting points. This means that each colour may freely choose
which of the remaining unoccupied starting points to use for its
first move. Pentobi currently only supports the rule variant with
coloured starting points because this rule variant was used on the
Blokus online server at blokus.com and in most of the past Blokus
tournaments.</p>
