<h3>Trigon Rules</h3>
<p>Trigon is another game variant. The rules a similar to game
variant Classic but it uses a differently shaped board and set of
pieces. Each colour uses 22 pieces that are shaped like the
polyiamonds up to size six. (A polyiamond is a figure built by a
number of equilateral triangles connected along the edges.)</p>

<p>Like in game variant Classic, Trigon can be played with two
players by having one player play Blue and Red and the other player
Yellow and Green.</p>
<h3>Trigon Rules for Three Players</h3>
<p>Trigon can be played with three players using the same rules as
for the four-player variant. The three-player variant is played on
a smaller board with an edge size of eight triangles. The six
starting points are located three rows from the middle of an
edge.</p>
