<h2>Nexos Rules</h2>
<p>Nexos is a board game similar to Blokus. The board is a rectangular 13Ã—13
line grid. Each color uses 24 pieces that consist of up to four connected line
segments.</p>

<div align="center" class="caption">The 24 pieces.</div>
<p>Each color has a starting intersection on the intersection of the third
lines close to a corner. The first piece must touch the starting
intersection.</p>

starting intersections marked with colored dots.</div>
<p>The following pieces must be placed on empty line segments such that a
segment of the new piece touches an intersection that is already touched by a
segment of the same color. It does not matter if pieces of other colors touch
or cover the same intersection. However, pieces may not overlap. The junctions
between the segments within a piece are such that two rectangular junctions of
different pieces can cover the same intersection without overlapping, but
straight junctions cannot.</p>

<p>The score of a color is the number of line segments on the board covered by
the color, plus a bonus of 10 points if the color could place all of its
pieces.</p>
<h3>Rules for Two Players</h3>
<p>Like Blokus, Nexos can be played with two players by having one player play
Blue and Red and the other player Yellow and Green.</p>
