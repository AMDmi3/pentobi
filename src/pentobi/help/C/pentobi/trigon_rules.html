<h2>Trigon Rules</h2>
<p>Trigon is another game variant. The rules a similar to game variant Classic
but it uses a differently shaped board and a different set of pieces. Each
color uses 22 pieces that are shaped like the polyiamonds up to size six. (A
polyiamond is a shape built by a number of equilateral triangles connected
along the edges.)</p>
