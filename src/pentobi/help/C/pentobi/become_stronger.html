<h2>Become a Stronger Player</h2>
<p>Pentobi has functionality that can help you to become a stronger
Blokus player.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Game Analysis</h3>
<p>A game can be analyzed by selecting <i>Analyze Game</i> from the
<i>Tools</i> menu. This will make the computer player evaluate each
position in the main variation. The result is displayed in a window
with a diagram of colored dots.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="analysis.jpg" alt=
"Game analysis window"></p>
<div align="center" class="caption">Game analysis of a game of
variant Classic (2 players).</div>
<p>Each dot represents a game position in which the color of the
dot is to play. The dots are ordered horizontally by move number.
The vertical axis represents the estimated probability of winning
the game for the color to play. Mouse clicks in the diagram will go
to the corresponding position.</p>
<p>The position values are only estimates and the computer will
sometimes evaluate positions incorrectly. But sudden drops in the
value can help you to find moves that were potentially bad. You can
go back to the position before the move and try to find a better
move or ask the computer what it would have played by selecting
<i>Play Single Move</i> from the <i>Computer</i> menu.</p>
<h3 id="rating">Determine Your Rating</h3>
<p>You can track your progress by playing rated games against the
computer. The game results are used to determine your current
rating. The rating is a number that represents your playing
strength.</p>
<p>A rated game is started with <i>Rated Game</i> from the
<i>Game</i> menu or the toolbar. If you have not played any rated
games in the current game variant, you will be asked to choose a
start value, which can reduce the number of games needed for
determining your real rating. If you are a beginner, leave the
start value at 1000.</p>
<p>For each rated game, the computer will choose a playing level of
the computer opponent according to your current rating. The color
you play will be randomly chosen in each game.</p>
<p>During a rated game, most of the functions not needed for
playing are disabled: you cannot undo moves, navigate in the game,
change the computer colors or change the playing level. To get an
accurate rating, you should always play rated games until the
end.</p>
<p>After the game has ended, your rating will be updated depending
on the game result and the computer level. For the game result, it
only matters if the game was won, lost or a tie. The exact number
of score points does not matter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rating.jpg" alt="Rating window"></p>
<div align="center" class="caption">Window with rating graph.</div>
<p>You can always see your current rating by selecting
<i>Rating</i> from the <i>Tools</i> menu. This will open a window
that shows the development of your rating during the last 100 games
as a graph. The last 100 games are automatically saved and can be
loaded by double-clicking on the rows in the game table below the
graph.</p>
