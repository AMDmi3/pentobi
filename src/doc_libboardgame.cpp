@page libboardgame_doc_tags Tags used in documentation
This page defines attributes of documentation elements that are in
widespread use. For brevity, the documentation block contains only
a reference to the section of this page.

@section libboardgame_avoid_stack_allocation Class size is large
The size of this class is large because it contains large members that are not
allocated on the heap to avoid dereferencing pointers for speed reasons. It
should be avoided to create instances of this class on the stack.

@section libboardgame_doc_obj_ref_opt Object reference optimization
This class uses a reference to a certain object several times but does not
store the reference at construction time for memory and/or speed optimization.
The reference is passed as an argument to the functions that need it. The
class instance assumes (and might check with assertions) that the reference
always refers to the same object .

@section libboardgame_doc_storesref Stores a reference
Used for parameters to indicate that the class will store a reference to the
parameter. The lifetime of the parameter must exceed the lifetime of the
constructed class.

@section libboardgame_doc_takesownership Takes ownership
Used for pointer-type parameters to indicate that the ownership of the object
instance will be transfered to the callee.

@section libboardgame_doc_threadsafe_after_construction Thread-safe after
construction
Used for classes that, that are thread-safe (w.r.t. different instances) after
construction. The constructor (and potentially also the destructor) is not
thread-safe, for example because it modifies non-const static class members.
