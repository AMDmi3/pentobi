Pentobi has functionality that can help you to become a stronger Blokus player.

<a name="analysis"></a>Game Analysis</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
A game can be analyzed by selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Analyze Game</span>
from the <span class="guimenu">Tools</span> menu. This will make the computer player
evaluate each position in the main variation. The result is displayed in a
window with a diagram of colored dots.
</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject">
<img src="../../C/pentobi/analysis.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Analysis of a game of variant Classic (2 players)</p></div>
</div></div>
<p>
Each dot represents a game position in which the color of the dot was to play.
The dots are ordered horizontally by move number. The vertical axis represents
the estimated probability of winning the game for the color to play. Mouse
clicks in the diagram will go to the corresponding position.
</p>
<p>
The position values are only estimates and the computer will sometimes
evaluate positions incorrectly. But sudden drops in the value can help you find
moves that were potentially bad. You can go back to the position before the
move and try to find a better move or ask the computer what it would have
played by selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Play Single Move</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Computer</span> menu.

<a name="rating"></a>Determine Your Rating</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
You can track your progress by playing rated games against the computer. The
game results are used to determine your current rating. The rating is a number
that represents your playing strength.
</p>
<p>
A rated game is started with <span class="guimenuitem">Rated Game</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Game</span> menu or the toolbar. If you have not played any rated
games in the current game variant, you will be asked to choose a start value,
which can reduce the number of games needed for determining your real rating.
If you are a beginner, leave the start value at 800.
</p>
<p>
For each rated game, the computer will choose a playing level for the computer
opponent according to your current rating. The color you play will be randomly
chosen in each game.
</p>
<p>
During a rated game, most of the functions not needed for playing are disabled:
you cannot undo moves, navigate in the game, change the computer colors or
change the playing level. To get an accurate rating, you should always play
rated games until the end.
</p>
<p>
After the game has ended, your rating will be updated depending on the game
result and the computer level. For the game result, it only matters whether the
game was won, lost or a tie. The exact number of score points does not
matter.
</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject">
<img src="../../C/pentobi/rating.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Window with rating graph</p></div>
</div></div>
<p>
You can always see your current rating by selecting
<span class="guimenuitem">Rating</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Tools</span> menu. This
will open a window that shows the development of your rating during the last 50
games as a graph. The last 50 games are automatically saved and can be loaded
by opening a context menu in the game table below the graph.
