<p>
There are four players, Blue, Yellow, Red and Green, and a board consisting of
20×20 squares. Each player has a set of 21 pieces of his color shaped like the
polyominoes up to size five. A polyomino is a shape built from a number of
squares connected along the edges.

</div></div>
<p>
The players alternate in placing one of their pieces on the board. The first
piece of a player must cover its starting square. The starting squares are
located in the corners of the board.

</div></div>
<p>
The following pieces must be placed on empty squares such that the new piece
touches at least one piece of its own color corner-to-corner but does not touch
any piece of its own color along the edges. The new piece may touch edges of
pieces of the opponent colors.

<p>
When the player of a color cannot place any more pieces, the player passes and
the next color continues. When none of the players can place any more pieces,
the player with the highest score wins. The score of a color is the number of
squares on the board occupied by the color, plus a bonus of 15 points if the
color could place all of its pieces, plus an additional bonus of 5 points if
the color could place all pieces and the last piece played was the one-square
piece.

<p>
The game can be played with two players. The first player plays both Blue and
Red, the second player Yellow and Green. The points of both colors played by a
player are added up.

<p>
The game can also be played with three players. The players take turns playing
the fourth color (Green). At the end of the game, the score of Green is
ignored.

<p>
Note that the original Blokus Classic rules used colorless starting points.
This means that each color may freely choose, which of the remaining unoccupied
starting points to use for its first move. Pentobi currently only supports the
rule variant with colored starting points because this rule variant was used on
the Blokus online server at blokus.com and in most of the past Blokus
tournaments.
