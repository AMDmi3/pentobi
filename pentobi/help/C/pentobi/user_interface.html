<p>
Pieces can be selected by clicking on one of the unplayed pieces or by using
<a class="link" href="shortcuts.html" title="Keyboard Shortcuts">shortcut keys</a>. Pieces can be played by
dragging them to a place that corresponds to a legal move with the mouse or
arrow keys and pressing the left mouse button or the Enter key.
</p>
<p>
Played pieces on the board can have numbers on them that indicate the move
number in which the piece was played. A letter after the move number indicates
that there exists a variation to this move (see below).
</p>
<p>
The score display shows the current points for each color or player. The points
are the sum of on-board points and bonus points. Points are underlined if they
are final because the color cannot play more pieces. A small star indicates
that the points include a bonus.

<a name="idm182"></a>Playing Against the Computer</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
The board can be used for creating game records of games played by humans or
for playing games against the computer. In games against the computer, the
computer can play any (or several) of the colors.
</p>
<p>
When you start a new game, the human will play the color(s) of the first
player by default and the computer all other colors. To change this, use
<span class="guimenuitem">Settings</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Computer</span> menu
or toolbar and select the colors the computer should play.
</p>
<p>
The exception is that the computer will play no color by default if it
played no color in the previous game. This prevents the computer from
automatically starting to play if the user mainly wants to use the board for
entering move sequences or similar editing tasks. After loading a saved game,
the computer also plays no color by default.
</p>
<p>
Selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Play</span> from the
<span class="guimenu">Computer</span> menu or the toolbar always makes the computer play
a move for the current color. If the computer did not already play this color
before, it will also make the computer play this color (and only this color)
from now on.

<a name="idm192"></a>Move Variations and the Game Tree</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
When you play a game, Pentobi will store the sequence of moves and it is always
possible to go back to a previous position and play differently. If you do
this, the new sequence is stored as an alternative sequence (called variation).
Variations can also be used by annotators for commenting on existing games.
Variations can exist at any board position and can have subvariations
themselves. The game can therefore become a game tree, in which each node
represents a board position. You can navigate in the game tree with the items
in the <span class="guimenu">Go</span> menu and the navigation buttons.
</p>
<p>
The main variation is the sequence of moves that starts at the start position
and always selects the first child node in each position (e.g. by pressing the
forward button). The main variation is supposed to represent the real game
played. If you want a side variation to become the main variation, select
<span class="guimenuitem">Make Main Variation</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Edit</span>
menu.
