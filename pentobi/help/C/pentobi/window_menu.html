<h2>Window Menu and Toolbar</h2>
<h3>Navigation Buttons in Toolbar</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Beginning</dt>
<dd>Go to the beginning of the game.</dd>
<dt>Backward 10</dt>
<dd>Go ten moves backward in the current variation. The button supports
autorepeat if pressed and held.</dd>
<dt>Backward</dt>
<dd>Go one move backward in the current variation. The button supports
autorepeat if pressed and held.</dd>
<dt>Forward</dt>
<dd>Go one move forward in the current variation. If the current position has
several follow-up variations (i.e. the current node in the game tree has
several child nodes), the first variation will be used. The button supports
autorepeat if pressed and held.</dd>
<dt>Forward 10</dt>
<dd>Go ten moves forward in the current variation. If a position has several
follow-up variations (i.e. the current node in the game tree has several child
nodes), the first variation will be used. The button supports autorepeat if
pressed and held.</dd>
<dt>End</dt>
<dd>Go to the end of the current variation. Like <i>Forward</i>, this also uses
the first variation in positions with several follow-up variations.</dd>
<dt>Next Variation</dt>
<dd>Go to the next variation to the last move played (i.e. the next sibling
node of the current node in the game tree).</dd>
<dt>Previous Variation</dt>
<dd>Go to the previous variation to the last move played (i.e. the previous
sibling node of the current node in the game tree).</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Game Menu</h3>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>Start a new game.</dd>
<dt>Rated Game</dt>
<dd>Start a new <a href="become_stronger.html#rating">rated game</a> against
the computer.</dd>
<dt>Game Variant</dt>
<dd>Select a game variant and start a new game of this game variant.</dd>
<dt>Game Info</dt>
<dd>Display or edit additional information about the game like the name of the
players or the date when the game was played.</dd>
<dt>Undo Move</dt>
<dd>Undo the last move played and remove it from the game tree. Undoing a move
is only possible if it is the last move in the current variation (i.e. a leaf
node in the game tree; use <i>Edit/Truncate</i> to remove inner nodes of the
game tree).</dd>
<dt>Find Move</dt>
<dd>Find a legal move for the current color and display it for a few seconds on
the board. Selecting this item repeatedly will show all legal moves.</dd>
<dt>Open</dt>
<dd>Load a saved game. The board position after loading will be the last
position in the main variation unless the game starts with a setup position. If
the game starts with a setup, the board position will be the first position
instead. This avoids that solutions are immediately shown if the file contains
a Blokus puzzle as a setup with the solution as the main variation.</dd>
<dt>Open Recent</dt>
<dd>Load a recently used game.</dd>
<dt>Open Clipboard</dt>
<dd>Open a game from a text copied to the clipboard. The text must be a valid
game in Pentobi SGF file format.</dd>
<dt>Save</dt>
<dd>Save the current game.</dd>
<dt>Save As</dt>
<dd>Save the current game under a new file name.</dd>
<dt>Export/Image</dt>
<dd>Save the current position as an image file. Several image file formats are
supported, the file format is derived from the file name ending (e.g. ".png"
for the PNG format). For a crisp image, the image width should be an integer
multiple of the number of board columns in the current game variant.</dd>
<dt>Export/ASCII Art</dt>
<dd>Save the current position as a text diagram. The text diagram should be
viewed using a monospace font.</dd>
<dt>Quit</dt>
<dd>Quit Pentobi.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Go Menu</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Move Number</dt>
<dd>Go to the move with a given move number in the current variation.</dd>
<dt>Main Variation</dt>
<dd>Go back to the last position in the current variation that belonged to the
main variation.</dd>
<dt>Beginning of Branch</dt>
<dd>Go back to the last position in the current variation that had an
alternative move.</dd>
<dt>Next Comment</dt>
<dd>Go to the next position that has a comment. If the comment text field was
not visible, it will become visible. Selecting this item repeatedly will show
all positions with comments in the game tree.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Edit Menu</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Annotation</dt>
<dd>Add a chess-style annotation symbol (e.g. !!) to the current move. The
symbols are appended to the move numbers in the status bar and, depending on
the configuration of <i>Move Marking</i>, on the board.</dd>
<dt>Make Main Variation</dt>
<dd>Make the current variation the main variation of the game. This reorders
the nodes in the game tree such that the current variation becomes the main
variation.</dd>
<dt>Variation Up</dt>
<dd>Changes the order of variations such that the current position will appear
earlier when iterating over the variations with <i>Next/Previous
Variation</i>.</dd>
<dt>Variation Down</dt>
<dd>Changes the order of variations such that the current position will appear
later when iterating over the variations with <i>Next/Previous
Variation</i>.</dd>
<dt>Delete Variations</dt>
<dd>Delete all variations but the main variation. If the current position is
not in the main variation, it will first be changed to a position as in <i>Back
to Main Variation</i>.</dd>
<dt>Truncate</dt>
<dd>Remove the node with the current position, including any subtree, from the
game tree.</dd>
<dt>Truncate Children</dt>
<dd>Remove all child nodes of the node with the current position from the game
tree.</dd>
<dt>Keep Position</dt>
<dd>Delete all moves and keep only the current position as a setup. This can be
used to create files that start with a given fixed position.</dd>
<dt>Keep Subtree</dt>
<dd>Like <i>Keep Position</i> but does not delete the moves after the current
position.</dd>
<dt>Setup Mode</dt>
<dd>Enter or leave setup mode. In setup mode, pieces can be placed anywhere on
the board, even in violation of the game rules. Existing pieces can be removed
from the board by clicking on them. The currently selected color also
determines the color to play after the setup is finished. It can be changed
with <i>Next Color</i> or by clicking on the orientation selector while no
piece is selected. Setup mode can only be used if no moves have been played
yet.</dd>
<dt>Next Color</dt>
<dd>Choose the next color for selecting pieces. This can be used for example to
enter game records, in which moves of a color were skipped because the color
ran out of time.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>View Menu</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Appearance</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Coordinates</dt>
<dd>Display coordinates around the board for the fields on the board. The
convention for the coordinates is the same as in the Blokus SGF file format
used by Pentobi.</dd>
<dt>Show variations</dt>
<dd>Appends a letter to the move number on the board if the move has
variations. If moves are marked with dots instead of numbers, a circle will be
used instead of a dot for moves not in the main variation.</dd>
<dt>Move number</dt>
<dd>This option exists only in desktop mode and shows the move number, move
annotation and variation information at the right side of the status bar.</dd>
<dt>Move marking</dt>
<dd>Change the way moves are marked on the board. The options are to mark the
last move played with a dot or with a number, or to show the numbers of all
moves, or not to show any marks.</dd>
<dt>Show comment</dt>
<dd>This option exists only in desktop mode and configures the visibility of
the comment area when the position changes. By default, the comment area is
only shown if a comment exists for the current position.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Comment</dt>
<dd>Toggle the visibility of the comment area in the current position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Fullscreen</dt>
<dd>Make the main window full screen or leave full screen mode. To leave full
screen mode without using the window menu, press the F11 key.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Computer Menu</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Settings</dt>
<dd>Select which colors are played by the computer and the playing strength for
the computer. Higher levels are stronger but can make the computer take a long
time for playing moves on slow computers.</dd>
<dt>Play</dt>
<dd>Make the computer play a move for the current color. This can be used to
change the color the computer plays or to resume playing after navigating in
the game tree. If the computer did not already play the current color, it will
play this color (and only this color) from now on.</dd>
<dt>Play Move</dt>
<dd>Make the computer play a single move for the current color without changing
the colors played by the computer.</dd>
<dt>Stop</dt>
