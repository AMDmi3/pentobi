Current development version
===========================

* German translation
* Support for the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR to allow installation
  in /usr and /etc. Previously CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/etc was hard-coded. This
  variable is also defined by the CMake module GNUInstallDirs but Pentobi does
  not use GNUInstallDirs yet because it would require CMake>=2.8.5.


Version 0.1 (15 Jul 2011)
=========================

Initial release.
