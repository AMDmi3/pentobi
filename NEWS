Current development version (bugfix branch for 1.0)
===========================

* Bugfix: file was not immediately visible in Recent Files menu after
  saving under a new name.
* Added explaining label to computer color dialog because window
  title is not visible in all L&F's
* Fixed a small bug that distorted the position values reported with
  --verbose if a subtree from a previous search was reused
* Bugfix: show error message instead of terminating if opening an
  invalid file
* Accept pass moves (without points) in files. Although the current
  Blokus SGF documentation does not specify if they should be allowed,
  they might be used in the future and are used in filews written by
  early (unreleased) versions of Pentobi
* Do not accept files with more moves in a variation than Pentobi can
  handle
* Extended the file format documentation by a hint how to put blksgf
  files on web servers


Version 1.0 (1 Jan 2012)
========================

* Support for game variant Trigon Three-Player
* Change directory for autosave file to use AppData
  (on Windows) or XDG_DATA_HOME (on other systems)
* Changed Back to Main Variation to go to the last move
  in the main variation that had a variation, not to the
  last position in the main variation
* Changed variation string in status bar to contain
  information about the move numbers at the branching points
* Fixed small rendering errors
* New menu item Find Next Comment
* Added chapters about the main window and menu items to
  the user manual
* Fix bug: computer color dialog did not set colors correctly
  in game variant Trigon
* Show error message instead of crashing if the SGF file
  contains invalid move properties
* Lowered the required version of the Boost libraries in
  CMakeLists.txt from 1.45 to 1.40 such that Pentobi can
  be compiled on Debian 6.0.
  Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if
  used with certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x
  (e.g. the combinations GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04
  and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work but the combination
  GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).
* Changed installation directories according to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard (/usr/bin to /usr/games, /usr/share to
  /usr/share/games)
* New CMake option PENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER for
  disabling the installation of files for registering the Pentobi
  thumbnailer on Gnome 2
* Install man pages for pentobi and pentobi-thumbnailer on Unix
  systems


Version 0.3 (2 Dec 2011)
========================

* Support for the game variants Trigon and Trigon Two-Player
* Fixed saving/opening files if file name contained non-ASCII characters and
  the system used an encoding other than Latin1
* The score numbers now show the total player and color scores instead of
  on-board and bonus points separatedly (feature request #3431039)
* New menu item "Edit/Select Next Color" that allows to enter moves independent
  of the color to play on the board (feature request #3441299)
* Slightly changed file format to use single-valued move properties as used in
  other games supported by SGF. Files written by Pentobi 0.2 can still be read.


Version 0.2 (17 Oct 2011)
=========================

* German translation
* Display sum score for both player colors in game variant Classic Two-Player
* Slightly changed file format to conform to the proposed version 5 of SGF that
  requires digits for move properties in multi-player games. Files written by
  Pentobi 0.1 can still be read.
* Support for move annotation symbols
* Store and edit additional game information (player names, date)
* New menu items Ten Moves Backward/Forward, Go to Move, Undo Move
* Underline move numbers if there are alternative variations
* Show move number, total number of moves and current variation in status bar
* Faster play in higher levels, especially of opening moves
* Make thumbnailer for Blokus files work under Gnome 3
* Fix broken compilation with GCC 4.6.1 (bug #3420555)
