Version 8.0 (02 Mar 2014)
=========================

* Increased playing strength, especially in game variant Trigon.
* Improved performance on multi-core CPUs: Previously, the move
  generation was faster on multi-core CPUs but there was a small drop
  in playing strength compared to the same playing level on a
  single-core CPU. This effect has been reduced.
* New toolbar button for starting a rated game.
* The interface is now more locked down during rated game, for example
  it is no longer possible to change the computer colors or take back a
  move during a rated game.
* The menu item "Computer Colors" was moved from the Game to the
  Computer menu.
* The source code no longer compiles with MSVC 2012 but requires
  MSVC 2013 because a larger subset of C++11 features is used.
* The source code distribution now uses xz instead of gzip for
  compression.
* The PNG versions of the icons are no longer included in the source
  code but generated at build time from the SVG icons by a small
  Qt-based helper program. This adds a build time dependency on QtSvg.
* A XPM icon is now installed to share/pixmaps.
* The configure option USE_BOOST_THREAD is no longer supported.
  For building with MinGW, a version of MinGW with support for
  std::thread is now required (e.g. from mingwbuilds.sf.net).


Version 7.2 (30 Jan 2014)
=========================

* Hyphens used as minus signs in manpage (bug #9)
* Added keywords section to desktop entry to silence lintian
  warning (bug #10)
* Fixed a compilation error with GCC 4.8.2 on PowerPC (and other
  big-endian systems)
* Fixed wrong arguments to update-mime-database/update-desktop-database
  when runing "make post-install"
* Improved a blurry menu item icon
* Fixed a compilation warning about a missing translation
* Reduced the sizes of the generated and installed translation files.
* Fixed a compilation error on 64-bit Linux with X32 ABI
* Fixed a compilation error with Cygwin


Version 7.1 (13 Aug 2013)
=========================

* Fixed the version string. The released file pentobi-7.0.tar.gz was
  erroneously built from git version c5247c56 just before the version
  tagged with v7.0 and contained the version string 6.UNKNOWN
* The color played by the human in rated games is now randomly assigned
* The mouse wheel is now disabled while the computer is thinking


Version 7.0 (25 Jun 2013)
=========================

* Support for compilation with version 5 of the Qt libraries (see INSTALL
  for details)
* Slightly increased playing strength at higher levels (mainly in game
  variant Duo)
* The default settings in game variants with more than two players are now
  that the human plays the first color and the computer all other colors
* Fixed a crash that could occur if the window was put in fullscreen mode
  by a method of the window manager (e.g. title bar menu on KDE) and then
  returned to normal mode by a different method (e.g. pressing Escape)


Version 6.0 (4 Mar 2013)
========================

* Increased playing strength at higher levels. The search algorithm used
  for move generation is now parallelized and can take advantage of
  multi-core CPUs (up to 4 cores). There is a new playing level 8, which
  has a 2 GHz dual-core CPU or faster as the recommended system requirement.
* New menu item Toolbar Text to configure the toolbar button appearance
  independent of the system settings
* More SGF game info properties (event, round, time) were added to the
  game info dialog
* The source code now requires at least GCC 4.7 (because a larger subset
  of C++11 features is used)
* The CMake module GNUInstallDirs is now used for setting the installation
  directories on Unix. Note that the defaults for bindir and datadir are
  now CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share instead of
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/games and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/games.
  They can be changed by setting CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR and
  CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR (bug #7)
* The source code no longer depends on the Boost libraries. However, it
  is still possible to use Boost.Thread instead of std::thread by
  configuring with USE_BOOST_THREAD=ON (e.g. needed on MinGW GCC 4.7,
  which has no functional implementation of std::thread)
* Thumbnailer registration for blksgf files is no longer supported for
  Gnome 2


Version 5.0 (10 Dec 2012)
=========================

* Small increase in overall playing strength at higher levels in all game
  variants (especially Trigon)
* The computer now knows about the possibility of rotational-symmetric tied
  games in game variant Trigon Two-Player (like it already knew in the
  variants Duo and Junior) and will prevent the second player from enforcing
  such a tie
* If the move generation takes longer than 10 seconds, the maximum remaining
  time is now shown in the status bar
* Removed less frequently used buttons (Open, Save) from the tool bar
* Re-organized menu bar
* The menu bar and tool bar are no longer shown in fullscreen mode
* Avoided some window flickering at startup


Version 4.0 (4 Oct 2012)
========================

* New menu item "Beginning of Branch"
* The rating dialog now also shows the best previous rating and has
  a button to reset the rating
* A thumbnail plugin for KDE can be built by using the CMake option
  -DPENTOBI_BUILD_KDE_THUMBNAILER=ON
* Replaced the icons with less colorful ones. All icons are now licensed
  under the GPLv3+ and include SVG sources. No icons from the Tango icon
  set are used anymore.


Version 3.0 (1 Aug 2012)
========================

* New functionality to compute a player rating for the user by playing
  rated games against the computer
* Different options for speed of game analysis
* New menu item "Play Single Move" to make the computer play a move
  without changing the colors played by the computer 
* The mouse wheel can now be used to navigate in the current variation
  if no piece is selected
* Files written by older versions of Pentobi that use a deprecated format
  for move properties are now automatically converted to the current format
  on write


Version 2.0 (22 May 2012)
=========================

* No more popup messages if a color has no more moves;
  instead, score points of this color are underlined
  (feature request #3431031)
* Newly supported game variant Junior
* Improved playing strength. Number of levels increased to 7.
  Level 7 is about the same speed as the old level 6 but stronger.
* New game analysis function that shows a graph with the estimated
  value of each position in a game (menu item "Computer/Analyze Game")
* Support for setup properties in blksgf files (note that files
  with setup properties cannot be read by older versions of
  Pentobi). A new setup mode can be used to create files that start
  with a setup position including positions that cannot occur in
  real games (e.g. for puzzles or Blokus art)
* New menu items for editing the game tree: "Delete All Variations",
  "Keep Only Position", "Keep Only Subtree", "Move Variation Up/Down",
  "Truncate Children"
* Variations are now displayed by appending a letter to the move number
  instead of underlining
* Added a toolbar button for fast selection of the computer colors
  without having to use the window menu.
* User manual is no longer compiled into the resources of the
  executable but installed in the installation data directory
* Open a console for stderr output on Windows if Pentobi is
  invoked with option --verbose
* New option --memory to make Pentobi run on systems with low
  memory at the cost of reduced playing strength.
* Use standard icons from theme


Version 1.0 (1 Jan 2012)
========================

* Support for game variant Trigon Three-Player
* Change directory for autosave file to use AppData
  (on Windows) or XDG_DATA_HOME (on other systems)
* Changed Back to Main Variation to go to the last move
  in the main variation that had a variation, not to the
  last position in the main variation
* Changed variation string in status bar to contain
  information about the move numbers at the branching points
* Fixed small rendering errors
* New menu item Find Next Comment
* Added chapters about the main window and menu items to
  the user manual
* Fix bug: computer color dialog did not set colors correctly
  in game variant Trigon
* Show error message instead of crashing if the SGF file
  contains invalid move properties
* Lowered the required version of the Boost libraries in
  CMakeLists.txt from 1.45 to 1.40 such that Pentobi can
  be compiled on Debian 6.0.
  Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if
  used with certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x
  (e.g. the combinations GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04
  and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work but the combination
  GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).
* Changed installation directories according to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard (/usr/bin to /usr/games, /usr/share to
  /usr/share/games)
* New CMake option PENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER for
  disabling the installation of files for registering the Pentobi
  thumbnailer on Gnome 2
* Install man pages for pentobi and pentobi-thumbnailer on Unix
  systems


Version 0.3 (2 Dec 2011)
========================

* Support for the game variants Trigon and Trigon Two-Player
* Fixed saving/opening files if file name contained non-ASCII characters and
  the system used an encoding other than Latin1
* The score numbers now show the total player and color scores instead of
  on-board and bonus points separatedly (feature request #3431039)
* New menu item "Edit/Select Next Color" that allows to enter moves independent
  of the color to play on the board (feature request #3441299)
* Slightly changed file format to use single-valued move properties as used in
  other games supported by SGF. Files written by Pentobi 0.2 can still be read.


Version 0.2 (17 Oct 2011)
=========================

* German translation
* Display sum score for both player colors in game variant Classic Two-Player
* Slightly changed file format to conform to the proposed version 5 of SGF that
  requires digits for move properties in multi-player games. Files written by
  Pentobi 0.1 can still be read.
* Support for move annotation symbols
* Store and edit additional game information (player names, date)
* New menu items Ten Moves Backward/Forward, Go to Move, Undo Move
* Underline move numbers if there are alternative variations
* Show move number, total number of moves and current variation in status bar
* Faster play in higher levels, especially of opening moves
* Make thumbnailer for Blokus files work under Gnome 3
* Fix broken compilation with GCC 4.6.1 (bug #3420555)
