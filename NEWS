Current development version (branch v2-fixes)
=============================================

* Bugfix: File was erroneously marked as modified if a multiline
  comment was shown and the platform that was used to create the
  file had Windows-style end of line convention and the platform
  on which the file was shown had Unix-style.
* Fixed the corruption of non-ASCII characters in game files on
  some platforms. 
* Fixed a case where the program froze instead of showing an error
  on certain syntax errors in the SGF file.
* Fixed duplicate menu shortcut in German translation
* Fixed too high floating point tolerance in unit tests.


Version 2.0 (22 May 2012)
=========================

* No more popup messages if a color has no more moves;
  instead, score points of this color are underlined
  (feature request #3431031)
* Newly supported game variant Junior
* Improved playing strength. Number of levels increased to 7.
  Level 7 is about the same speed as the old level 6 but stronger.
* New game analysis function that shows a graph with the estimated
  value of each position in a game (menu item "Computer/Analyze Game")
* Support for setup properties in blksgf files (note that files
  with setup properties cannot be read by older versions of
  Pentobi). A new setup mode can be used to create files that start
  with a setup position including positions that cannot occur in
  real games (e.g. for puzzles or Blokus art)
* New menu items for editing the game tree: "Delete All Variations",
  "Keep Only Position", "Keep Only Subtree", "Move Variation Up/Down",
  "Truncate Children"
* Variations are now displayed by appending a letter to the move number
  instead of underlining
* Added a toolbar button for fast selection of the computer colors
  without having to use the window menu.
* User manual is no longer compiled into the resources of the
  executable but installed in the installation data directory
* Open a console for stderr output on Windows if Pentobi is
  invoked with option --verbose
* New option --memory to make Pentobi run on systems with low
  memory at the cost of reduced playing strength.
* Use standard icons from theme


Version 1.0 (1 Jan 2012)
========================

* Support for game variant Trigon Three-Player
* Change directory for autosave file to use AppData
  (on Windows) or XDG_DATA_HOME (on other systems)
* Changed Back to Main Variation to go to the last move
  in the main variation that had a variation, not to the
  last position in the main variation
* Changed variation string in status bar to contain
  information about the move numbers at the branching points
* Fixed small rendering errors
* New menu item Find Next Comment
* Added chapters about the main window and menu items to
  the user manual
* Fix bug: computer color dialog did not set colors correctly
  in game variant Trigon
* Show error message instead of crashing if the SGF file
  contains invalid move properties
* Lowered the required version of the Boost libraries in
  CMakeLists.txt from 1.45 to 1.40 such that Pentobi can
  be compiled on Debian 6.0.
  Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if
  used with certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x
  (e.g. the combinations GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04
  and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work but the combination
  GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).
* Changed installation directories according to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard (/usr/bin to /usr/games, /usr/share to
  /usr/share/games)
* New CMake option PENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER for
  disabling the installation of files for registering the Pentobi
  thumbnailer on Gnome 2
* Install man pages for pentobi and pentobi-thumbnailer on Unix
  systems


Version 0.3 (2 Dec 2011)
========================

* Support for the game variants Trigon and Trigon Two-Player
* Fixed saving/opening files if file name contained non-ASCII characters and
  the system used an encoding other than Latin1
* The score numbers now show the total player and color scores instead of
  on-board and bonus points separatedly (feature request #3431039)
* New menu item "Edit/Select Next Color" that allows to enter moves independent
  of the color to play on the board (feature request #3441299)
* Slightly changed file format to use single-valued move properties as used in
  other games supported by SGF. Files written by Pentobi 0.2 can still be read.


Version 0.2 (17 Oct 2011)
=========================

* German translation
* Display sum score for both player colors in game variant Classic Two-Player
* Slightly changed file format to conform to the proposed version 5 of SGF that
  requires digits for move properties in multi-player games. Files written by
  Pentobi 0.1 can still be read.
* Support for move annotation symbols
* Store and edit additional game information (player names, date)
* New menu items Ten Moves Backward/Forward, Go to Move, Undo Move
* Underline move numbers if there are alternative variations
* Show move number, total number of moves and current variation in status bar
* Faster play in higher levels, especially of opening moves
* Make thumbnailer for Blokus files work under Gnome 3
* Fix broken compilation with GCC 4.6.1 (bug #3420555)


Version 0.1 (15 Jul 2011)
=========================

Initial release.
