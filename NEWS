===========================

Version 1.0b1 (15 Dec 2011)
===========================

Pre-release of version 1.0

* New menu item Find Next Comment
* Added chapters about the main window and menu items to
  the user manual
* Fix bug: computer color dialog did not set colors correctly
  in game variant Trigon
* Show error message instead of crashing if the SGF file
  contains invalid move properties
* Lowered the required version of the Boost libraries in
  CMakeLists.txt from 1.45 to 1.40 such that Pentobi can
  be compiled on Debian 6.0.
  Note: some versions of Boost cause compilation errors if
  used with certain versions of GCC and option -std=c++0x
  (e.g. the combinations GCC 4.4/Boost 1.40 in Ubuntu 10.04
  and GCC 4.4/Boost 1.42 in Debian 6.0 work but the combination
  GCC 4.5/Boost 1.42 in Ubuntu 11.04 causes errors).
* Changed installation directories according to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard (/usr/bin to /usr/games, /usr/share to
  /usr/share/games)
* New CMake option PENTOBI_REGISTER_GNOME2_THUMBNAILER for
  disabling the installation of files for registering the Pentobi
  thumbnailer on Gnome 2
* Install man pages for pentobi and pentobi-thumbnailer on Unix
  systems


Version 0.3 (2 Dec 2011)
========================

* Support for the game variants Trigon and Trigon Two-Player
* Fixed saving/opening files if file name contained non-ASCII characters and
  the system used an encoding other than Latin1
* The score numbers now show the total player and color scores instead of
  on-board and bonus points separatedly (feature request #3431039)
* New menu item "Edit/Select Next Color" that allows to enter moves independent
  of the color to play on the board (feature request #3441299)
* Slightly changed file format to use single-valued move properties as used in
  other games supported by SGF. Files written by Pentobi 0.2 can still be read.


Version 0.2 (17 Oct 2011)
=========================

* German translation
* Display sum score for both player colors in game variant Classic Two-Player
* Slightly changed file format to conform to the proposed version 5 of SGF that
  requires digits for move properties in multi-player games. Files written by
  Pentobi 0.1 can still be read.
* Support for move annotation symbols
* Store and edit additional game information (player names, date)
* New menu items Ten Moves Backward/Forward, Go to Move, Undo Move
* Underline move numbers if there are alternative variations
* Show move number, total number of moves and current variation in status bar
* Faster play in higher levels, especially of opening moves
* Make thumbnailer for Blokus files work under Gnome 3
* Fix broken compilation with GCC 4.6.1 (bug #3420555)
